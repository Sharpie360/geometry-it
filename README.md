# geometry-it
My first javascript app from scratch. Area calculator for simple shapes.
 
User interface takes in data then returns the result on screen. 
User can pick between 3 shapes, and 3 units of measurement. 

Looking to DRY code the class changes for the shape buttons.

Always looking for feedback if you happen to find this. 
Help me to make improvements.

Learning Github.
Cheers.
